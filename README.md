Parallel SSH
============

This is a fork of the wonderful project at http://code.google.com/p/parallel-ssh/

A goal of this fork is to keep up to date with the original repository. Ideally we would set up a trigger so updates from the main project will populate to this repo automatically.

Another goal is to submit patches to the original project so we can contribute back.


Changes
=======

  * Adding `padb`. This is a parallel implementation of the Android Device Bridge command to allow for easier management of multiple Android devices via USB or adb over tcp.
